# 🌿 Green-Sutra: AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System

Green-Sutra is a smart and accessible agricultural advisory platform designed specifically for small and marginal farmers in India. 🌾 With a focus on increasing crop yield, resource efficiency, and financial resilience, Green-Sutra combines **Artificial Intelligence**, **IoT sensors**, and **Natural Language Processing** to offer context-aware recommendations that help farmers make better decisions throughout the cultivation cycle. 📊 From identifying the next best crop to planning resource allocation and protecting fields, the platform addresses the key pain points of modern farming in a data-driven yet user-friendly way.

👨‍🌾 Farmers can interact with the platform using regional languages through a **voice-based interface**, making technology approachable even in the remotest areas. Green-Sutra not only guides farmers on **what to grow** and **how**, but also connects them to **government schemes**, **agricultural advisors**, and **marketplaces** — minimizing dependence on middlemen and helping them access timely support and improved profits.

🔁 To improve accuracy, the system learns from **feedback** — recording outcomes like **yield after each season** and refining its recommendations based on real-world results. Additionally, **IoT sensors** in the field detect unexpected movements (like animal intrusion 🐄) and send instant alerts to the farmer’s phone 📱, reducing the risk of crop damage.

💡 At its core, Green-Sutra empowers farmers with answers to four essential questions:  
👉 What to grow?  
👉 How to manage resources?  
👉 Where to invest for the best returns?  
👉 And how to stay informed in real time?



## 🌟 Features

- Personalized crop recommendations based on soil type, climate, and season.  
- Smart irrigation and fertilizer suggestions to optimize resource usage.  
- Disease prediction and early warning system using climate and crop data.  
- Voice-based multilingual interface for ease of use in rural communities.  
- Real-time alerts for animal intrusion and field threats using IoT sensors.  
- Connectivity to advisors, government schemes, and trusted buyers.  
- Seasonal feedback tracking to enhance prediction accuracy over time.  
- Weather forecasting to aid short-term planning and disaster readiness.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Green-Sutra is built using **Python** for the core logic and advisory engine. The **Google Gemini API** powers the NLP and conversational intelligence features, allowing seamless **multilingual interaction**. 🌐 A curated dataset — enriched with data from **ICAR**, **KVKs**, and global agricultural organizations — serves as the backbone of AI-based predictions.

🔧 **Arduino-based sensors** are deployed in the field to detect physical threats like animal invasions and send alerts through a **web interface** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system also uses **TTS/STT APIs** to offer **speech-based input and feedback** for better accessibility.



## 🌱 Real-World Applications

This application is ideal for farmers who need localized and timely advice without access to expert agronomists. Whether it’s predicting the **next suitable crop** based on **soil and climate**, managing **fertilizers and water stress** efficiently, or receiving **disease warnings** tied to environmental conditions — Green-Sutra delivers actionable insights directly to the farmer. 🎯

It reduces **waste**, increases **productivity**, and supports **informed decision-making**. Additionally, the platform connects farmers with **trusted buyers** and **government welfare programs**, unlocking better **market opportunities** and **financial aid**. 💰



## 🚀 Future Scope

Green-Sutra is designed for scalability. In the future, we plan to introduce **mobile-based disease detection using images**, integrate **drone and satellite data** for soil and yield analysis, and offer **smarter credit recommendations**. 📡 As adoption grows, the platform will evolve into a **full-scale ecosystem** — one that empowers Indian agriculture with sustainable, intelligent, and inclusive technology.
